This algorithm was suggested by Dijkstar, the name banker is used here to indicate 
that it uses a banker’s activity for providing loans and receiving payment against
the given loan. This algorithm places very few restrictions on the processes 
competing for resources. Every request for the resource made by a process is 
thoroughly analyzed to check, whether it may lead to a deadlock situation. If 
the result is yes then the process is blocked on this request. At some future 
time, its request is considered once again for resource allocation. So this 
indicated that, the processes are free to request for the allocation, as well 
as de-allocation of resources without any constraints. So this generally reduces
the idling of resources.
Suppose there are (P) number of Processes and (r ) number of resources then 
its time complexity is proportional to P x r2
At any given stage the OS imposes certain constraints on any process trying
to use the resource. At a given moment during the operation of the system, 
processes P, would have been allocated some resources. Let these allocations 
total up to S.
Let (K=r-1) be the number of remaining resources available with the system. 
Then k>=0 is true, when allocation is considered.
Let maxk be the maximum resource requirement of a given process Pi.
Actk be the actual resource allocation to Pi at any given moment.
Then we have the following condition.
Maxk<=p for all k and
To
Disadvantages of Banker’s algorithm:
1. The maximum number of resources needed by the processes must be known in advance
2. The no of processes should be fixed.
