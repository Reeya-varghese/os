Step 1: Start the process
Step 2: Accept the number of processes in the ready Queue
Step 3: For each process in the ready Q, assign the process id and accept the CPU burst time
Step 4: Set the waiting of the first process as ‘0’ and its burst time as its turn around time
Step 5: for each process in the Ready Q calculate
(a) Waiting time for process(n)= waiting time of process (n-1) + Burst time of process(n-1)
(b) Turn around time for Process(n)= waiting time of Process(n)+ Burst time for process(n)
Step 6: Calculate
(a) Average waiting time = Total waiting Time / Number of process
(b) Average Turnaround time = Total Turnaround Time / Number of process
Step 7: Stop the process
